# Contributing to the Datastore

The following is a set of guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

### Open Development
All work on the Datastore happens directly on GitHub. Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.

### Branch Organization
We will do our best to keep the master branch in good shape, with tests passing at all times. But in order to move fast, we will make API changes that your application might not be compatible with. We recommend that you use the latest stable version of the Datastore. If you send a pull request, please do it against the master branch.

### Semantic Versioning
The Datastore follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org). We release patch versions for bugfixes, minor versions for new features, and major versions for any breaking changes. When we make breaking changes, we also introduce deprecation warnings in a minor version so that our users learn about the upcoming changes and migrate their code in advance.

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* Check if you can reproduce the problem [in the latest version of the Datastore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@espresso-org/datastore) as the issue may be already resolved.
* Determine which repository the problem should be reported in.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Aespresso-org)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an Atom command, and if so which one?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **Which version of Node are you using?** (`node -v`)
* **What's the name and version of your browser**?
* **What's the version of aragon-cli you're using**


### Sending a Pull Request

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free video series:

[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

To help you get your feet wet and get you familiar with our contribution process, we have a list of ["good first issues"](https://github.com/espresso-org/aragon-datastore/labels/good%20first%20issue) that contain bugs that have a relatively limited scope. This is a great place to get started.

If somebody claims an issue but doesn’t follow up for more than two weeks, it’s fine to take it over but you should still leave a comment.

### Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from master.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. If you’ve fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!
4. Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test` or `yarn test`). 
5. Make sure everything builds (`npm run build` or `yarn build`)


### Styleguides

#### Javascript

1. Use `const` for all of your references; avoid using `var`. eslint: [`prefer-const`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-const.html), [`no-const-assign`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-const-assign.html)
2. If you must reassign references, use `let` instead of `var`. eslint: [`no-var`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-var.html)
3. Use the literal syntax for object creation. eslint: [`no-new-object`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-new-object.html)
4. Use object method shorthand. eslint: [`object-shorthand`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/object-shorthand.html)
5. Prefer the object spread operator over [`Object.assign`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) to shallow-copy objects. Use the object rest operator to get a new object with certain properties omitted.
6. Use the literal syntax for array creation. eslint: [`no-array-constructor`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-array-constructor.html)
7. Use array spreads `...` to copy arrays.
