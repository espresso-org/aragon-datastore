# Contributing to the Datastore

The following is a set of guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.


### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* Check if you can reproduce the problem [in the latest version of the Datastore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@espresso-org/datastore) as the issue may be already resolved.
* Determine which repository the problem should be reported in.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Aespresso-org)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
